            <p>
                Well. What a dramatic start to RLIS Season 6 we’ve had. On overall standings, we’ve had a tight battle up top between Enwrong and LovelyCans, with them (as of writing) drawn at 78.5. Managers like Barzey and Ryan who built their teams around “vibes” haven’t
                done quite as well, with the Saints languishing at the bottom having only 37 points to their name. So, as we enjoy exciting games every week, it does make you wonder what goes on in these managers heads. I’ve composed 4 questions for each
                of them. Let’s start off with the most interesting:<br><br>

                <strong>1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you with how your teams have performed so far?</strong><br><br> Ryan (Saints): I'd say about a 4/10 at the minute, the season has kinda been riddled with problems and admittedly I made two
                mistakes with regards to player selections.<br><br> Ooh, some sauce there. We may but wonder at who he means…<br><br> DLynch (High Kings): I'd probably go for around a 5 or 6 out of 10, some teams are doing better than others but overall,
                I'm happy with the effort of all my teams. Squid-G (Celtic Tigers): 8 - everyone is having fun and playing when they can, can't ask for much more than that!<br><br> LovelyCans (Banshees): I would say 8 out of 10, as we are placed where
                I expected. All teams are in the running for playoffs at the moment and I’m well in the running for MOTS against Na Gaels and then Celtic Tigers as dark horses. There have been 1 or 2 series where we dropped winnable series’ but the first
                goal is playoffs and then win at least 2 or 3 tiers. Big ambitions there from the GOAT of RLI himself, and he undoubtedly has the track record to back up his predictions, winning Manager of the Season during the last two RLIS seasons.
                Now onto the shorter answers:<br><br> Enwrong (Na Gaels): 8<br><br> Barzey (Wolfhounds): 7<br><br>

                <strong>2. Do you think you're in the running to win in any tier?</strong><br><br> Ryan: I'd say if things go right for us, we can still take Rising Star, and possibly Ascending and Shooting Star.<br><br> Enwrong: Yes, we’re looking super
                strong in All Star.<br><br> Barzey: My Superstar team has a good chance at winning, and I’m optimistic about Ascending Star. My Rising Star team have shown that they’re a contender as well so I’m happy overall.<br><br> LovelyCans: At the
                moment I would say All-Star is the best chance which was always the case for the Banshees xD where last week we beat probably the favourites besides ourselves in the High Kings. Now we do have to see what Na Gaels are like next week but
                I do think we are capable of winning every tier, the only tough task would be Superstar as I don’t think my team has shown their full potential as of late but there’s plenty of time to fix that.<br><br> DLynch: Now obviously winning any
                tier will be tough but we're definitely in the running as are many other teams at taking a title because playoffs are all about who turns up on the day and I think that any team who makes playoffs can win.<br><br> Squid-G: I think my Superstar,
                All Star and Shooting Star teams are all super strong. If they're on their game nobody is gonna stop them! Ascending and Rising Star feel a bit more day to day but can still easily upset anyone!<br><br>

                <strong>3.	Who has performed the best for you out of all your players?</strong><br><br> Squid-G: Trace has been clapping boys, great first pick :muscle:<br><br> Ryan: I think Shallow obviously has been a rock as expected. Viaable has been
                what I'd hoped he'd be in rising star and is still rapidly improving.<br><br> LovelyCans: Well, there's no way I’m not talking about myself, have you seen the top performers for the last 2 weeks in All-Star? Like c’mon I had to sub in
                last week for my superstar team to carry Pandaa and Goldie so they wouldn't mess up another 3s series xD. Nah in fairness I picked 5 solid squads who are all doing their bit in continuing the Banshees reign in RLIS.<br><br> Big words there
                from the big bossman, and they did win the 3s 3-1 so he may be correct.<br><br> Enwrong: I think Chef has been the best. Honourable mentions to Cloudy, Spectre and Nailer who’ve all performed well too.<br><br> Barzey: I'd have to go with
                one of the Superstar boys, probably Reece.<br><br> DLynch: That's a really tricky question and obviously all my players have done well but I'd have to go with Aidan who I've been most impressed by so far because we know he's been quality
                in the past but he's been amazing this season.<br><br> And finally…<br><br>
                <strong>4.	Tell us a secret about how you manage your teams.</strong><br><br> DLynch: Well, the secret to managing my teams is actually drafting this org’s previous manager and letting the teams run themselves, because each player knows
                their own tiers well and I trust my captains. (Except Finbarr dog player)<br><br> Well to this I can only react with :eyes:<br><br> Squid-G: I try not to micromanage and pick people I know who are quite vocal within the discord, which
                usually means I don't need to chase anybody and the teams generally are super friendly with each other. 4 out of the 5 rosters also have pairs who already play with each other quite often so even if it's not the best season, everyone will
                have a bit of fun regardless.<br><br> Ryan: Usually I factor in personalities and playstyles a lot when I’m picking my teams, unfortunately this season has been riddled with problems so far, from scheduling issues, internet problems, and
                a few bad decisions on my part.<br><br> Barzey: Draft Lynsk and he does all the work.<br><br> Enwrong: I give as much freedom as I can to each of the teams, it’s up to them to do their homework and play as much as they can, I do motivate
                them to do this, however I tend not to coach them as I don’t like micro managing them, it’s a game after all.<br><br> LovelyCans: Put the fear of god into them basically. If I see any stupid double commits, I will let them know about it,
                like I just tell me teams to not over complicate things, and always focus on 3s during league play if we can get a 2s or 1s series on top of that that's a win and if we win 3-0 overall then MUP Banshees!!!!!<br><br> So overall a lot of
                interesting takeaways here. Some managers making a point of not micromanaging, whereas it looks like Cans has decided to go the completely opposite direction and put himself rent-free into all of his players’ heads. Who knows what the
                best way to manage is? We’ll have to wait until the end of the season for the answer.<br><br>
