            <p class="news--excerpt"><a href="rlis-s6-halfway-recap.html">Well. What a dramatic start to RLIS Season 6 we’ve had. On overall standings, we’ve had a tight battle up top between Enwrong and LovelyCans, with them (as of writing) drawn at 78.5. Managers like Barzey and Ryan who built their teams around “vibes” haven’t
                done quite as well, with the Saints languishing at the bottom having only 37 points to their name. So, as we enjoy exciting games every week, it does make you wonder what goes on in these managers heads. I’ve composed 4 questions for each

But there’s one thing missing out of all our lives right now, and that’s LovelyCans hitting the high notes screaming
                over a belter game of Rocket League. But sometimes, even a late night with Cans in Lobby 2 won’t cut it. You need to up the stakes. And they don’t get much higher than... <span style="color: orangered">﹥</span></a></p>
