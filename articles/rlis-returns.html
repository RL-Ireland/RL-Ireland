                European Championships, Gaelic Games, the Olympics even. It’s been a summer for sports fans to savor up and down the country. But there’s one thing missing out of all our lives right now, and that’s LovelyCans hitting the high notes screaming over a belter
                game of Rocket League.<br><br> But sometimes, even a late night with Cans in Lobby 2 won’t cut it. You need to up the stakes. And they don’t get much higher than RLIS which returns to RL Ireland, beginning August 9th.<br><br>After
                several months on hiatus, RL Ireland Superstars, now in its sixth season, brings a return to the roots of RLI after the completion of the Wylde Rocket Series that ran during the spring and early summer months.<br><br>Today we sit down
                to preview the upcoming season with RLI admin Enwrong, and the man who’ll be the first to tell you he’s the greatest RLIS manager of them all, LovelyCans.<br><br>RLIS sees 6 teams battling it out through a league and playoffs for a shot
                at glory. Spread across 4 tiers that are based around skill level, season 6 will mark a return of the classic multi format rounds that sees opponents take part in a 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 series. A format that Enwrong believes will spice up
                the upcoming draft.<br><br><strong>“I’m always excited by emerging talents, it’s obviously rare to see them at the top level in Ireland but there’s a heap of mid level players who are looking to make a name for themselves in the scene…
                We’ve returned to the original RLIS formula of 1s, 2s and 3s which we think will make the draft and the season itself extra spicy.”</strong> - Enwrong<br><br>As the RLI server has grown since the last RLIS, a number of exciting individuals
                has emerged onto the scene. From behind closed doors, several exciting teams should emerge. For LovelyCans, one such player showed his worth during the recent WRS.<br><br><strong>“Tomster who first came into the RLI scene in the recent 12 Titans and got Top 8 following with a WRS finals appearance with myself, and recently won the Slibhin Series. He will be one to watch.”</strong>                - LovelyCans<br><br>
                <strong>“I’m delighted already by the sign up numbers we are seeing, if we can get to 4 tiers we’ve done well, but 5 is the goal.”</strong> - Enwrong<br><br>With several tiers based on skill level, one aspect of the RLIS that makes it
                special has been the access to lower ranked players to competitions usually reserved for those ranks we all dream of hitting some day. As Enwrong explained, it was a priority for RLI and as members spoke more about it, it was the logical
                things to do.<br><br><strong>“A lot of people in the community were looking for something more community focused as a tournament, as a lot of them felt that while WRS aimed to get at grassroots Irish Rocket League, they didn’t feel it achieved that….You’re only as strong as your members after all.”</strong>                - Enwrong<br><br> For LovelyCans it brings about another chance to prove himself as the manager of The Banshees, the most successful org in the history of RLIS.<br><br><strong>“All eyes will be on us so I will have to be at my sharpest when it comes to draft as I can pick a really strong group of players… I’m once again gunning for that manager of the season for the 3rd time while also trying to add another title to my cabinet and of course looking to challenge for silverware in other tiers like previous seasons.”</strong>                - LovelyCans<br><br>As the excitement builds amongst the RLI community, it’s also growing for the men working behind the scenes. The return of a familiar format and the chance for newer members to stamp their name into the server is clearly
                something important to see for two long serving stalwarts.<br><br><strong>“Hopefully a lot more people are engaging in the server, particularly the “lower” level players as we want to see these guys at LANs as well in future. I want everyone to enjoy themselves, it’s a great tournament with a unique flavour to it since you only play people around your level.”</strong>                - Enwrong<br><br><strong>“I love RLIS since it first started with its unique format and balance tiers which gave us some great moments (*Cough* SEASON 1) but the community has always enjoyed the hype leading to draft day and there’s a buzz around the server too which is fantastic.” “It’s something I would love to go on for seasons to come but that of course depends on numbers. I would like for everyone to play to their best and most importantly to have fun which would entice them to join next season or other RLI tournaments.”</strong>                - LovelyCans<br><br>Sign ups are available to those wishing to take part until August 4th with the draft beginning shortly after. With league play kicking off on the 9th of August, it will be an exciting time for all members of RL Ireland.
