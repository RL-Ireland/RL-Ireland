                As an IEL league winner at the management level, and having been a team manager for so long, you start to notice certain patterns that can be applied to successful teams. I have also won RLIS Ascending-Star as a player as the 3rd pick on the team so I
                had a lot less influence on how things went, but there are still things that I learned from that season as well.
                <br><br>In this article I want to name some of the key ingredients that I consider to be important if you want to go far in RLIS. So grab a pen and paper, and see how many of them you think apply to your team.<br><br><strong>1: The Manager</strong><br>The
                manager obviously plays an important role. In most leagues the manager will have to pick the best team possible and then motivate their players week to week or game to game. In RLIS however, the manager also needs to have that extra bit
                of tactical nous to deploy his players in the 1v1 and 2v2 games in the most effective way possible. See if you can spot when managers choose to throw certain 1s or 2s games, I bet there’ll be a few through-out the season.
                <br><br><strong>2: The Captain</strong><br>We all know that in any competitive environment you’re going to get some fiery individuals, that is why the captain is so important. Of course, you need someone who’s going to organise the games
                week after week and not get their team into any trouble with the authorities. Equally important however is to have someone on your team that is able to stay calm and motivate the team to do their best, this may be the team’s official captain
                or it may be another player. Having someone with this type of personality will likely stop your team from throwing games<br><br><strong>3: The 1v1 Specialist</strong><br>While a 1v1 is worth less than the other game modes, no-one will
                want to throw any games away. Having someone on your team that you can bet the house will win their 1v1 match can really lift a team at times, and depending on the order of your games, can be a nice momentum builder as well. In 95% of
                cases as well your 1v1 specialist will also be your mechanical freak in 3s and most likely in 2s as well, meaning that this is the guy that’s going to give you a shout at winning any series, regardless of who you’re up against.<br><br><strong>4: The Reliable Rotator</strong><br>Flashy
                moments are great, and mechanics can be amazing, but both are useless if you keep conceding at the wrong end of the pitch as well. Every team is going to need that reliable rotator. Someone in the team who is willing to stay back at times
                and keep it simple. In 2v2 and especially in 3v3 it’s so important to have a player that’s going to give you that defensive backbone. They won’t be able to save every shot by themselves, but at least they’ll give your team half a chance
                at keeping the other team out.<br><br><strong>5: The Coach</strong><br>Something that from my experience is fairly under-utilised is the potential for coaching. In all tiers bar one, there are going to be better players than you in the
                same org as you. Managers and players alike should be looking to make the most of this by asking some of the higher quality players in the org to look at replays and see where your team or you individually are going wrong. Coaches won’t
                be able to win the league for you… but maybe they’ll stop you from being out of boost and out of position on 0 seconds.<br><br><strong>Ideal Org</strong><br><br><strong>The Manager:</strong><br><em>Prime Dave Forehead</em><br>Active, encouraging,
                absolute dreamboat in a pair of shorts and crocs.<br><br><strong>The Coach:</strong><br><em>High level player</em><br>Arguably a player that is only 1 or maybe 2 tiers above, but coaching is coaching<br><br><strong>The Team:</strong><br><em>1st Pick:</em>                Reliable Rotator / Captain<br>In my opinion, having your best player be that safe defensive player can give you so much control of a game, or at the very least, keep you in a game if your struggling<br><br><em>2nd Pick:</em> 1v1 Specialist
                / Captain<br>Like I said, you want a 1v1 specialist somewhere in the team, and in my opinion you want it to be your 2nd pick because then you’re getting someone who’s going to be roughly as good as the top players in terms of speed and
                mechanics, but doesn’t quite have positioning down yet<br><br><em>3rd Pick:</em> Any<br>What type of player the 3rd pick is, completely depends on the first 2 picks. Ideally however you would want a 3rd pick who is on the quicker side
                so they’re not too out of their depth. If the drop off in skill between picks 2 and 3 then you probably don’t want your 3rd pick being the “captain” of the team and trying to motivate players trying to carry them.
