        "bio": "Robert 'Enwrong' Enright is RLI's current server owner. He became an admin on the 13th of July, 2016. He joined RLI after attempting to (along with one of his friends, sasm8) make an RL Ireland website (completely unrelated to the original Facebook page which RLI grew from), specifically for one tournament aimed at Irish Rocket League players. It didn't have much success, but through the process of making it, Enwrong found the Facebook page and joined it. He has since won precisely fuck all, and has adminned most tournaments for RLI."

He retired on the 28th of June, 2021, and now spends his time as Overlord of Some McDonalds Somewhere Probably, drinking copious amounts of Football Special and reminiscing about the good old days. Or so I've heard."
